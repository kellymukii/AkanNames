Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.

Male
Sunday: Kwasi

Monday: Kwadwo

Tuesday: Kwabena

Wednesday: Kwaku

Thursday:  Yaw

Friday: Kofi

Saturday: Kwame

Female
Sunday: Akosua

Monday: Adwoa

Tuesday: Abenaa

Wednesday: Akua

Thursday:  Yaa

Friday: Afua

Saturday: Ama

Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born. Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date. The following is one of the many methods that exist for that;

Day of the week (d) = ( ( (CC/4) -2*CC-1) + ((5*YY/4) ) + ((26*(MM+1)/10)) + DD ) mod 7

 where;

 CC - is the century digits. For example 1989 has CC = 19

 YY - is the Year digits (1989 has YY = 89)

 MM -  is the Month

 DD - is the Day of the month 

 mod - is the modulus function ( % )

USER STORY
 As a user, I would like to;

See a  small description of what the application does on the landing page.
Enter my birthday through a form 
Choose what gender I am.
Click the submit button to see what my Akan name would be
Requirements 
The application should check whether the date and month entered is valid. if either of them is invalid,  the user should be alerted and asked to enter a valid one. For example:
        An invalid day should be (d<=0) or (d>31)

        An invalid month should be (m<= 0) or (m > 12)  

The application should output to the user their Akan name depending on their gender. For example, if a user is male and the result of the calculation is 0, then the application should match that with Kwasi since Kwasi corresponds to Sunday which has an index 0. Hence the output the user will see should be something like “Your Akan name is Kwasi”
